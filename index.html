<p>Cats are very majestic creatures to have as pets. Cats have been around as pets for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians used to have cats as pets.Cats were so important to the Egyptians that even when Pharoh's were mummified they would be buried with their pet cats. Cats were so influential that even one of the Egyptian gods, Bastet, has the head of a cat.</p>
